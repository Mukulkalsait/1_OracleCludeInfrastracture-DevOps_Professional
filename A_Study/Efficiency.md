# 🚀 Efficient Setup for Running Docker & Kubernetes on WSL (Low Resource System)

You’re on **Windows + WSL2** with 16GB RAM. Running browsers, YouTube, WhatsApp Web, Oracle training, **Docker, Kubernetes, and DevOps tools** can eat a lot of RAM.  
Here’s the **most efficient approach** for you, with a **CLI-first + TUI tools** mindset.

---

## 🐧 WSL Optimization

1. **Limit WSL Memory Usage**  
   Create/edit file:
   ```ini
   %UserProfile%\.wslconfig
   ```

[wsl2]
memory=6GB
processors=4
swap=8GB

👉 This ensures Docker/K8s don’t eat all your RAM.

    Use Lightweight Linux Distro in WSL
        Ubuntu (recommended)
        Debian (lighter than Ubuntu)

🐳 Docker CLI + TUIs

    Docker CLI → default and most efficient.
    Docker TUI Tools:
        lazydocker → TUI for Docker & Docker Compose.
        ctop → "htop for containers", monitor resources.

Install lazydocker:

brew install lazydocker # or: go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker@latest

☸️ Kubernetes CLI + TUIs

- Kubernetes CLI: kubectl → core CLI

- Kubernetes TUI Tools:
  1. k9s → TUI to manage clusters (like lazygit but for K8s)
  2. kubectx + kubens → quick switch between contexts & namespaces

Install k9s:
brew install derailed/k9s/k9s
Install kubectx + kubens:
brew install kubectx

📦 Package Managers for Speed

    Homebrew on Linux → fast installation of tools
    asdf → manage multiple versions of Node, Rust, Go, Java, etc.

📊 Resource Monitoring

    btop → better than htop, shows CPU/RAM/disk
    nvtop → GPU usage (if you use CUDA/ML)

Install k9s:

brew install derailed/k9s/k9s

📦 Package Managers for Speed
Homebrew on Linux → fast installation of tools.

📊 Resource Monitoring

    btop → better than htop, shows CPU/RAM/disk.
    nvtop → GPU usage (if you use CUDA/ML).

Install btop:

sudo apt install btop

🌐 Browser Management (to save RAM)

    Use Arc Browser or Brave (lighter, better tab management).
    Use YouTube on mpv player (CLI lightweight media player):
    mpv https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
    👉 Saves RAM vs keeping YouTube tabs open.

🛠️ Workflow Recommendation

    Use browser only for training portal + WhatsApp Web.
    Run YouTube videos in mpv.
    Run Docker using CLI or lazydocker.
    Run Kubernetes using k9s.
    Monitor resources with btop.
    Keep all configs + notes in Neovim + Obsidian/Docusaurus.

✅ Summary of Tools

    Docker → CLI + lazydocker[]  + ctop
    Kubernetes → kubectl, k9s, kubectx
    Monitoring → btop, nvtop
    Efficiency → mpv, Homebrew, asdf
    🚀 Optional: Quick Docker + Kubernetes Setup on WSL2

👉 Use Kind if you want clusters inside Docker (lighter).
👉 Use Minikube if you want a standalone K8s experience.

Do you want me to also add **recommended `.wslconfig` + Docker Desktop settings (resource limits, GPU passthrough,
Do you also want me to add **installation commands for WSL2 → Docker + Kubernetes setup\*\* (like `minikube` or `kind`) in

👉 This `.md` can be dropped straight into your **Docusaurus knowledge base** so you don’t have to retype things.
