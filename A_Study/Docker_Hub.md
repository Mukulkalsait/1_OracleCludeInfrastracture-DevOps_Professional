Perfect idea 👍 A single `.md` cheatsheet for **Docker Hub daily usage** will be gold for you.
Here’s a **comprehensive collection** of commands and flows you’ll need most often.

---

# 🐳 Docker Hub Commands Cheatsheet

## 🔑 Authentication

```bash
# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Logout
docker logout
```

---

## 📥 Pull Images (Download from Docker Hub)

```bash
# Pull latest version of an image
docker pull nginx

# Pull a specific version/tag
docker pull redis:7.2

# Pull multiple architectures if supported (e.g., arm64, amd64)
docker pull --platform linux/arm64 nginx
```

---

## 📤 Push Images (Upload to Docker Hub)

1. Build or have an image locally:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

2. Tag it with your Docker Hub username:

```bash
docker tag myapp:latest yourusername/myapp:v1
```

3. Push to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push yourusername/myapp:v1
```

---

## 📦 Clone / Use Images

Docker doesn’t use the word _clone_, you simply **pull** and **run** images.

```bash
# Pull and run in one go
docker run -it --rm yourusername/myapp:v1

# Pull first, then run
docker pull yourusername/myapp:v1
docker run -d --name testapp yourusername/myapp:v1
```

---

## 🏷️ Image Tagging

```bash
# List all local images
docker images

# Tag an image with a new name/version
docker tag localimage:latest yourusername/repo:tag

# Retag and push as `latest`
docker tag yourusername/myapp:v1 yourusername/myapp:latest
docker push yourusername/myapp:latest
```

---

## 🧹 Image & Container Cleanup

```bash
# Remove a container
docker rm -f mycontainer

# Remove an image
docker rmi myimage:tag

# Remove dangling images
docker image prune

# Remove all unused (containers, networks, images)
docker system prune -a
```

---

## 📜 Inspect Images & Containers

```bash
# Inspect image details
docker inspect nginx

# Inspect container details
docker inspect mycontainer

# View logs of a container
docker logs mycontainer
```

---

## 🔄 Updating Images

```bash
# Pull latest version
docker pull nginx:latest

# Remove old container
docker rm -f mynginx

# Run with updated image
docker run -d --name mynginx -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```

---

## 🗂️ Save & Load Images (for backups, moving without Docker Hub)

```bash
# Save image to tar file
docker save -o myapp.tar yourusername/myapp:v1

# Load image from tar file
docker load -i myapp.tar
```

---

## 🔗 Linking GitHub/GitLab to Docker Hub (Auto-Build)

- Push code to GitHub.
- Configure Docker Hub “Builds” → connect repo.
- On every GitHub push → Docker Hub builds new image automatically.

---

## 💡 Common Real-World Flows

- **Share your app**:

  ```bash
  docker build -t myapp .
  docker tag myapp yourusername/myapp:v1
  docker push yourusername/myapp:v1
  ```

  Then others can run:

  ```bash
  docker run -d yourusername/myapp:v1
  ```

- **Test latest community images**:

  ```bash
  docker pull postgres:16
  docker run -d -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
  ```

---

🔥 Tip: Always use **semantic version tags** (`:v1.0.0`, `:2025-09`) instead of only `:latest` in company projects, so you can control deployments.
