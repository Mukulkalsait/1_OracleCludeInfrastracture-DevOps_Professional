Good question 👍 you’re talking about **distroless images** (from Google’s `gcr.io/distroless/*`) that don’t include an OS package manager or full Linux distribution — just the minimal runtime needed.

But in some cases, you don’t even need a runtime layer at all, because your app is compiled into a **static binary**. That means the image can be basically _scratch_ (empty), and still work.

---

### ✅ Languages / cases where you don’t need a runtime in the image

- **Go (Golang)** → Most common case.
  - Go produces a fully static binary (when built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`).
  - You can run `FROM scratch` and just copy the binary.
  - Example:

    ```dockerfile
    FROM golang:1.23 AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o myapp

    FROM scratch
    COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
    ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
    ```

- **Rust** → Also compiles down to a single binary.
  - If you link statically (`musl`), no runtime needed.
  - Same pattern: `FROM scratch` + copy binary.

- **C / C++** → If you compile statically (with `musl` or `-static` flags), you can ship the binary in `scratch`.
  - If you link dynamically against glibc, you’ll need at least a minimal runtime (`distroless/cc` or `alpine`).

- **Nim, Zig, D, Crystal** → These languages also produce native binaries that can be statically linked → no runtime required.

### ⚠️ Languages that **DO** need runtimes (so distroless provides them)

- **Java** → Needs a JVM → `distroless/java` or `distroless/java17`.
- **Node.js** → Needs Node runtime → `distroless/nodejs`.
- **Python** → Needs interpreter → `distroless/python3`.
- **.NET (C#)** → If published as self-contained with trimming (`dotnet publish -r linux-x64 --self-contained true`), you can go `FROM scratch`. Otherwise → `distroless/dotnet`.

---

### 📌 So in short:

- **No runtime required** → Go, [ Rust ], C/C++ (static), Zig, Nim, D, Crystal.
- **Runtime required** → Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.
- **Optional** → .NET → self-contained vs framework-dependent.

👉 Do you want me to give you a **ready-to-use minimal Dockerfile template** for each of these languages (Go, Rust, C++) that works with `FROM scratch`?
