# DevOps Overview – Key Exam & Practice Notes

====================================================================================================================================

# FASTTRACK:

## models: waterfall -> Agile -> scrum -> devops

    Waterfall: linear dev | stage by stage | returning to previous stage is hard, costly | best for building bridge or tower.
    Agile: flexible , iterative , adaptable | Accommodate changes & collab.
    Scrum: Sprints of Agile.
    DevOps: Collab + communication in development and operation team. => faster release | frequent developement | faster error resolvement => low risk of error.

## Story Context – Why DevOps? =

    Waterfall -> agile |
    $DEV: tight deadlines (code/bugfix, slow release) vs $OPS: resource content, constant redesign,rapid issue resolvement, customer demands |
    $DEV Wants frequent changes $OPS Wants Stability.

## What is DevOps? = continous delivery | collab dev+ops | Automation + programmable infra | fast release | ++quality | Agile+lean+os oreanted. | Rapid Delivary.

## Why DevOps Matters => Unifide Infra & Workflow | + productivity, +Efficiency, +security | Dynamic Lifecycle | low error-> reduce reword | release frequency

## Dev Side: PCBT

1. Plan – Requirements, backlog, sprint planning.
2. Code – Develop features & fixes.
3. Build – Compile.
4. Test – Automated/manual.

## Ops Side: RDOM

5. Release – Approve & prepare for production.
6. Deploy – Push to production safely.
7. Operate – Manage live systems.
8. Monitor – Observe performance, collect feedback.

## CI, CD, and Continuous Everything => agile dev| CI-requent integration+ detect issues early CD-Automated Delivery | + continous Monitoring(stability improvement) |

- DevOps => CI + CD + Continuous Testing + Continuous Monitoring + Continuous Feedback → end-to-end business solution.

## Benefits of DevOps=> HIGI - Connection, engagement & colab | ++quality ++fastIssueResolv ++stability ++release ++flexibility ++innovation ++Predictability | --Cost --time |

1.  Story Context – Why DevOps? =

    Waterfall -> agile |
    $DEV: tight deadlines (code/bugfix, slow release) vs $OPS: resource content, constant redesign,rapid issue resolvement, customer demands |
    $DEV Wants frequent changes $OPS Wants Stability.

        Case: Head & Heart Holistic Healthcare
        Pandemic growth created need for rapid scaling.
        Previous models: Waterfall → Agile → Still struggling to meet demand.
        Pain points:
        Dev side: tight deadlines, bug fixing, code management, slow release cycles.
        Ops side: resource contention, constant redesign requests, rapid issue resolution, customer demands.
        Conflict: Devs want frequent changes; Ops want stability.
        Impact: Customer loss, high costs, poor coordination, no CI plan.

2.  What is DevOps? = continous delivery | collab dev+ops | Automation + programmable infra | fast release | ++quality | Agile+lean+os oreanted. | Rapid Delivary.

        Definition: A way of =>  working enabling continuous delivery by improving collaboration between Dev & Ops.
        Core Principle: Automation + programmable infrastructure → faster releases, improved quality, competitive advantage.
        Cultural Shift: Agile + Lean + System-oriented thinking → continuous culture.
        Goal: Rapid IT service delivery + stability.

3.  Why DevOps Matters => Unifide Infra & Workflow | + productivity, +Efficiency, +security | Dynamic Lifecycle | low error-> reduce reword | release frequency

        Breaks silos → unified infrastructure & workflows.
        Improves productivity, predictability, efficiency, and security.
        Makes software lifecycle programmable & dynamic.
        Helps detect bugs early → reduces rework.
        Increases release frequency & reliability.

4.  DevOps Lifecycle – 8 Phases

        Dev Side: PCBT
                    1. Plan – Requirements, backlog, sprint planning.
                    2. Code – Develop features & fixes.
                    3. Build – Compile.
                    4. Test – Automated/manual.
        Ops Side: RDOM
                    5. Release – Approve & prepare for production.
                    6. Deploy – Push to production safely.
                    7. Operate – Manage live systems.
                    8. Monitor – Observe performance, collect feedback.

5.  CI, CD, and Continuous Everything => agile dev| CI-requent integration+ detect issues early CD-Automated Delivery | + continous Monitoring(stability improvement) |

    DevOps => CI + CD + Continuous Testing + Continuous Monitoring + Continuous Feedback → end-to-end business solution.

        Agile: Iterative development (Plan → Build) but doesn’t ensure smooth post-release ops.
        CI: Frequent integration to detect issues early.
        CD: Automated delivery up to deployment.
        Continuous Operations & Monitoring: Ongoing stability & improvement.

6.  Benefits of DevOps=> HIGI - Connection, engagement & colab | ++quality ++fastIssueResolv ++stability ++release ++flexibility ++innovation ++Predictability | --Cost --time |

        Culture: Connected teams, higher engagement, collaborative environment.
        Technical:
        Higher quality software.
        Faster problem resolution.
        Greater stability & reliability.
        Business:
        Lower IT costs.
        Faster time-to-market.
        Predictable delivery.
        Increased flexibility & innovation.
